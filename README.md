Sample app with multiple view controllers

Mock up of a music player which displays 6 different playlists.  Selecting a playlist triggers a push transition to 2nd view controller which displays the songs for the given playlist.

For the sake of simplicity, playlist data is hardcoded in a separate swift file.
